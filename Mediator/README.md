## Design Pattern details
Type:
* Behavioral

Applicability:
* To a set of objects that communicate in well-defined but complex ways.
* To allow for greater reuse of an object, an object which refers to and communicates with many other objects.
* To easily customize the behavior which is distributed between several classes, without a lot of subclasses.

Pros:
* It limits subclasses.
* It decouples colleagues.
* It simplifies object protocol - replaces many-to-many interactions with one-to-many.
* It abstracts the interaction of objects.

Cons:
* Mediator class can become a monolith which is hard to maintain.
