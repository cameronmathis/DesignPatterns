## Design Pattern details
Type:
* Structural

Applicability:
* To avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation. Specific implementation can be selected at run-time.
* To independently extend abstraction and implementation via subclasses. Different abstractions can be combined with different implementations.
* Changes in the implementation of an abstraction should have no impact on the clients.

Pros:
* Decouples interface and implementation.
* Hides implementation detail from client.
