## Design Pattern details
When to use:
* A system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented
* A system should be configured with one of many families of products
* A family of related objects is designed to be used together and you need to enforce this
* You want to provide a class library of products and you want to reveal only their interfaces

Pros:
* It isolates concrete classes
* It makes exchanging family products easy
* It promotes consistency among products

Cons:
* Supporting new kinds of products is difficult
