## Design Pattern details
Type:
* Structural

Applicability:
* To add responsibility to individual objects dynamically and transparently, that is, without affecting other objects.
* For responsibility that can be withdrawn,
* When extension via subclasses is impractical.

Pros:
* More flexibility than static inheritance - responsibilities an be added and removed at run-time.
* Avoids feature-laden classes high up in hierarchy. Responsibility is added on demand.

Cons:
* It may produce a system with lots of little look-alike objects. the objects only differ in the way they are interconnected. These systems can be hard to learn and debug.
