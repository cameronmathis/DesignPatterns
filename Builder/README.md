## Design Pattern details
Type:
* Creational

Applicability:
* The algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that makes up the object and how they are assembled.
* The construction process must allow different representations of the parts that make up the object and how they are assembled.

Pros:
* It lets you vary a products internal representation.
* Isolates code for construction and representation.
* It gives you finer control over the construction process.
