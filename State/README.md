## Design Pattern details
Type:
* Behavioral

Applicability:
* When an object's behavior depends on its state, and it must change its behavior at runtime depending on the state.
* To avoid large switch statements for state-specific behavior.

Pros:
* It localizes state-specific behavior and partitions behavior for several states.
* It makes state-transition explicit and more atomic.
* State objects can be shared as flyweights.
