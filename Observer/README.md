## Design Pattern details
Type:
* Behavioral

Applicability:
* When an abstraction has two aspects, the view (observer) aspect, and the document (subject) aspect.
* To notify other objects (observers) of the change.
* When the number of observers is unknown.

Pros:
* Abstract coupling between subject and observer.
* Support for broadcast communication.

Cons:
* Simple update protocols provide no detail on what changed in the subject.
