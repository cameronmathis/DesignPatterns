## General info
This is a project I did in order to practice implementing design patterns. In order to run and learn more about each individual design pattern, navigate to the appropriate design pattern folder. </br>
You can also run each design pattern demo from the main folder with the command:

	$ ./run.sh [DesignPattern]

Where the design pattern is one word with the first letter of each word capitalized. (EX: $./run.sh AbstractFactory)
