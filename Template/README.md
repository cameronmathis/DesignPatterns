## Design Pattern details
Type:
* Behavioral

Applicability:
* To implement the invariant part of an algorithm.
* When common behavior among subclasses should be factored and localized in a common class to avoid code duplication.
* To control subclass extension.

Pros:
* It is a fundamental technique for code reuse.
* It lets the subclasses refine the (default) behavior of an operation.
