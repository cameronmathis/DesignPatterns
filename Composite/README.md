## Design Pattern details
Type:
* Structural

Applicability:
* To represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
* To be able to ignore the differences between containers and primitives. Clients will treat all objects in the composite pattern uniformly.

Pros:
* Clients can treat composite structures (containers) and individual objects (primitives) uniformly.
* Makes it easier to add new kinds of components.

Cons:
* Can make design overly general. Sometimes you want the component to have certain kinds of components.
